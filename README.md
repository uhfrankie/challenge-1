# challenge-1
For the week 1 challenge, I attempted to make the code on the Horiseon Project look "cleaner" by removing and replacing the div tags. I used VSCode to make the changes and then published it to my Github repository. While changing the code, I ran into some issues with keeping the images on the "benefits" section, so I added < figure > to see if it would help keep the images in place and it did.
